# Binairo-solver
A Binary Puzzle can be solved according to the following rules:

Each box should contain a zero 0 or a one 1.
No more than two similar numbers next to each other in a row.
Each row should contain an equal number of zeros and ones.
Each row is unique. These rules apply to both horizontal as vertical rows (columns).
I used backtrack and forward checking algorithms to solve Binairo puzzles with different board sizes (66, 88, etc.)
