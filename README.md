# Binairo-solver
A Binary Puzzle can be solved according to the following rules:

1. Each box should contain a zero 0 or a one 1.
2. No more than two similar numbers next to each other in a row.
3. Each row should contain an equal number of zeros and ones.
4. Each row is unique. These rules apply to both horizontal as vertical rows (columns).

I used backtrack and forward checking algorithms to solve Binairo puzzles with different board sizes (6*6, 8*8, etc.)
